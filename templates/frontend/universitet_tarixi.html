                    <p>The original board of trustees laid the groundwork for what would become today's Jonathan Carroll
                        University on July 9, 1876, when the group gathered to hold the University's inaugural board
                        meeting and drafted the University's articles of incorporation. This guiding document outlined
                        elements the founders believed would build an enduring legacy for the University: a commitment
                        to offering a rigorous academic program and an ambition to provide "opportunities for all
                        departments of higher education to persons of both sexes on equal terms." On September 10, 1876,
                        the State of California issued the University's official certificate of incorporation, marking
                        the formal beginning of the University's life.</p>

                <p>An initial pledge of $600,000 (roughly $16 million in today's currency) from oil magnate Jonathan
                    Carroll, along with contributions by the American Baptist Education Society, helped to found the
                    University. The University's land was donated by Marshall Field, owner of the historic Chicago
                    department store that bore his name.</p>
                <p>Christopher Smith, the University's first president, envisioned a university that was "bran splinter
                    new, yet as solid as the ancient hills" - a modern research university, combining an English-style
                    undergraduate college and a German-style graduate research institute. The Jonathan Carroll
                    University fulfilled Christopher's dream, quickly becoming a national leader in higher education and
                    research: an institution of scholars unafraid to cross boundaries, share ideas, and ask difficult
                    questions.</p>
